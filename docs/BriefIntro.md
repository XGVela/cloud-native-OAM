# Cloud Native OAM

## Background

**Cloud Native OAM** is a group of operation and management functions to serve 
network functions' basic operation and management requirements, which includes 
but not limited to NF's configuration manegement, NF's application topology management, 
NF's performance management, NF's alarm management, NF's log management, NF's heartbeat
management, NF's signaling trace management, etc.



As the above operation and management functions are independent from network functions'
business logics, they can be shared as common and reusable services among multiple network 
functions, which means they can be treated as a group of XGVela Telco PaaS capabilities.
Providing cloud native OAM functions as a PaaS capabilities can relief developers from 
spending too much effort on non-NF logic design and coding.
